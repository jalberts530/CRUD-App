#Project Requirements
#Contains a README.md file which provides instructions for how to install and use the program.
#Contains a app/products_app.py file which represents the Python program.
#Contains an empty data directory except for presence of a data/.gitignore file (see setup instructions).
#Contains a commit history which reflects incremental development progress, perhaps corresponding with the checkpoint steps.
